# [Jin'rokh The Breaker](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/jin-rokh-the-breaker-strategy-guide-normal-heroic>)
This is a nice simple first fight with a single phase and some fairly straightforward mechanics

The boss goes through 4 cycles before enraging:
1. Buildup
1. [Thundering Throw](#thundering-throw) where there is [Conductive Water](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands) that grows to fill 1/4 of the room
1. Burn
1. [Lightning Storm](#lightning-storm) where the previous [Conductive Water](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands) becomes [Electrified Water](#electrified-water) for the rest of the fight

The final [Lightning Storm](#lightning-storm) happens at about 7 mibnutes and will mean that the whole room is now doing damage to the raid and that they have only moments to finish the fight.

In addition to the cycles of [Thundering Throw](#thundering-throw) and [Lightning Storm](#lightning-storm) he will be continuously using [Static Burst](#static-burst), which does raid damage and triggers a tank swap, and [Focused Lightning](#focused-lightning) which forces the ranged to move and place a [Lightning Fissure](#lightning-fissure) on the ground.

Beyond the basic loop, it is an easy dps check.

`10-man Normal with 6 DPS: 70k DPS;`

## Strategy:
- Kite the [orb](#focused-lightning-orb) to the walls, then allow it to drop the [fissure](#lightning-fissure)
    - Do not drag an [orb](#focused-lightning-orb) over a [fissure](#lightning-fissure)
    - Do not drag an [orb](#focused-lightning-orb) over another character
    - If you are about to get an orb dragged over you, move. Especially if you are in [Conductive Waters](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands)
- Run into [Conductive Waters](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands) immediately after the tank lands from [Thundering Throw](#thundering-throw)
    - Ranged: spread so that you can run from an [orb](#focused-lightning-orb)
    - Alternate tank: taunt boss and pull him near the [Conductive Waters](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands)
        - Don't stand in the [Conductive Waters](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands) because of the increased nature damage.
- When the boss begins casting [Lightning Storm](#lightning-storm) run out of [Conductive Waters](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands) and stack in the middle under the boss
    - Healers: use c/d for raid damage
- Tanks: Swap immediately after [Static Burst](#static-burst) is cast.
