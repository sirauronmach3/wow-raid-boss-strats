# [Jin'rokh The Breaker](<https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/jin-rokh-the-breaker-strategy-guide-normal-heroic>)
This is a single phase fight with some fairly straightforward mechanics

The boss goes through 4 cycles before enraging:
1. Buildup
1. [Thundering Throw](#thundering-throw) where there is [Conductive Water](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands)
1. Burn
1. [Lightning Storm](#lightning-storm) where the previous [Conductive Water](#conductive-water-forms-on-the-ground-where-the-target-lands) becomes [Electrified Water](#electrified-water)

The final [Electrified Water](#electrified-water) will mean that the whole room is now doing damage to the raid and they have only moments to finish the fight.

In addition to the cycles of [Thundering Throw](#thundering-throw) and [Lightning Storm](#lightning-storm) he will be continuously using [Static Burst](#static-burst), which triggers a tank swap, and [Focused Lightning](#focused-lightning) which forces the ranged to move and place a [Lightning Fissure](#lightning-fissure) on the ground.

Beyond the basic loop, it is a dps check.

## Mechanics

#### [Thundering Throw](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=137167>)
- Knocks the current active tank back into one of the 4 statues in the room (one in each corner), landing them in front of the now destroyed statue.
- Resets threat for the target
- Does some damage to target
- When the target lands, they and everyone within 14 yards are stunned for 6 seconds.
- I haven't found a consensus on which statue gets targetted, but I believe it is the closest statue to the boss.
- ##### [Conductive Water](<>) forms on the ground where the target lands.
    - Pool starts small, but grows to take up 1/4 of the room
    - Applies the [Fluidity](#fluidity) buff when standing in the pool
    - Lasts 90 sec
- Strat:
    - Everyone: stay away from the still standing statues
    - Everyone: stand in the [Conductive Water]()
    - Ranged: Maximize distance from boss
