A core component of this boss is using the vehicle controls of the [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct), which everyone will experience being inside of at some point. During phase 3, there will no longer be an escape mechanic from the vehicle.
#### [Mutated Construct](<>)

## Phase 1
Phase ends when Amber-Shaper gets to 70% health

This phase is just the Amber-Shaper and the [Living Amber](#living-amber) created by his [Amber Scalpel](#amber-scapel).

### Phase 1 Mechanics
- #### [Amber Scalpel](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=1245000/amber-scalpel>)
  - Slow moving laser which fixates random player
  - Drops pools on ground which will disipate eventually
    - Pools do continuous damage
    - Pools occasionally spawn [Living Amber](#living-amber).

- #### [Living Amber](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/npc=248104/living-amber>)
  - Add spawned from pool left behind [Amber Scalpel](#amber-scalpel)
  - Fixates on a random player
  - Explodes when it dies:
    - Damage to players within 8 yards
    - Healing to Amber Creatures (including [Living Amber](#living-amber) and [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct))
  - Leaves [Burning Amber](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=123020/burning-amber>), when it dies.
    - a pool which does ~75k when inside it

  - Strat:
    - Target: kite the add away from melee, avoid letting it hit you.
    - Ranged: These are DPS priority. If one is targetting a healer, it becomes TOP priority.


- #### [Parasitic Growth](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=121949/parasitic-growth>)
  - DoT, 30k dps
  - Damage scales with healing received
  - Strat:
    - Healers: top up character when targetted
    - Healers & Target: Shield character
    - Healers & Target: Avoid healing unless necessary

- #### [Reshape Life](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=122370/reshape-life>)
  - Transforms a character into a [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct)
  - In phase 1, this only happens to the tank
  - Strat:
    - DPS: Prioritize dropping [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct) to below 20% health immediately before swapping back to the boss.
