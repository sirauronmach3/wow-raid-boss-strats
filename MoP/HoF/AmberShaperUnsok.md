This boss will summon 3 types of adds: [Constructs](#mutated-construct-construct), [Ambers](#living-amber-amber), and a [Monstrosity](#amber-monstrosity).

A core component of this boss is using the vehicle controls of the [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct), which everyone will experience being inside of at some point. During phase 3, there will no longer be an escape mechanic from the vehicle.
#### [Mutated Construct](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/npc=62701/mutated-construct>) *(Construct)*

## Phase 1
Phase ends when Amber-Shaper gets to 70% health

This phase is just the Amber-Shaper and the [Living Amber](#living-amber) created by his [Amber Scalpel](#amber-scapel).

### Phase 1 Mechanics
- #### [Amber Scalpel](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=1245000/amber-scalpel>)
  - Slow moving laser which fixates random player
  - Does 90k dps
  - Drops Molten Amber residue (pools) on ground which will disipate eventually
    - Pools do continuous damage - 40k dps - to players who touch it
    - Pools occasionally spawn [Living Amber](#living-amber).

- #### [Living Amber](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/npc=248104/living-amber>) *(Amber)*

  - Add spawned from pool left behind [Amber Scalpel](#amber-scalpel)
  - Fixates on a random player
  - Aura does 1.5k dps to raid
  - Explodes when it dies:
    - 70k damage to players within 8 yards
    - Healing to Amber Creatures (including [Living Amber](#living-amber) and [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct)) 40% of max health
  - Leaves [Burning Amber](#burning-amber), when it dies.

  - Strat:
    - Target: kite the add away from melee, avoid letting it hit you.
    - Ranged: These are DPS priority. If one is targetting a healer, it becomes TOP priority.
    - Raid Lead: call out priority change "Ambers are up, ranged focus", "Amber on Heals, marked skull, range focus"

- #### [Burning Amber](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=123020/burning-amber>)
  - a pool which does 45k dps when touching it or within 3 yards
  - Can be picked up by [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct) for healing
  - Strat:
    - Everyone: leave these alone until phase 3
    - Everyone: Stay at least 3 yards away


- #### [Parasitic Growth](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=121949/parasitic-growth>)
  - DoT, 12k dps, 30 sec
  - Damage scales with healing received
  - Strat:
    - Healers: top up character when targetted
    - Healers & Target: Shield character
    - Healers & Target: Avoid healing the target unless necessary

- #### [Reshape Life](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=122370/reshape-life>)
  - Transforms a character into a [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct)
  - In phase 1, this only happens to the tank
  - Can be healed by [Living Amber](#living-amber)'s death explosion.
  - Strat:
    - DPS: Prioritize dropping [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct) to below 20% health immediately before swapping back to the boss.
    - Raid Lead: call out priority change: "Construct up, swap dps to construct", "Stop dps, swap back to boss"
    - If Construct catches a [Living Amber](#livin]g-amber) explosion, it needs to be dropped below 20% again. Then, follow the above strats.
    - Tanks: follow priority algorithm for [Mutated Construct](#mutated-construct) above.
    - Tanks: drop out of construct before the current active tank is transformed. You cannot tank the boss as a construct, they take additional damage from the boss.

## Phase 2
The boss gets 1 new ability, but otherwise has all the same abilities as the previous phase. Now anyone can be targetted by [Reshape Life](#reshape-life).
- #### [Amber Carapce](<>)
  - Boss gets a 99% damage reduction until [Monstrosity](#amber-monstrosity-monstrosity) is destroyed
