She will alternate between phase 1 & 2 until she reaches 30% health, then move into phase 3. She can only get pushed into phase 3 from phase 1.

There is no enrage timer.

Bloodlust in Phase 3

This is a HEALING INTENSIVE fight (especially phase 3). Most guides recommend 3 heals, but between Patrick and me we feel that isn't ideal and hopefully not necessary for our raid comp.

That means that everyone needs to avoid things that are going to tax the healers in any additional way. Short of dying, deal with things however best you can. 

Y'all are the heroes, no one is coming to save you.

## Phase 1
Phase lasts 2.5 minutes, or until boss reaches 30% health.

There is only 1 enemy, the boss

Focus DPS on the boss

We'll be using [Dread Screech](#dread-screech) to focus down one of the [Dissonance Shields](#dissonance-shield)

### Phase 1 Mechanics:
- #### [Eyes of the Empress](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=123707/eyes-of-the-empress>)
  - Tank Debuff
  - Stacks up to 5 times, at 5 the tank will be permanently dominated with [Servant of the Empress](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=123713/servant-of-the-empress>). This will be a wipe, period.
  - Strat: Swap at 3 - 4 stacks
  
- #### [Dread Screech](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=123735/dread-screech>)
  - Targets and damages 1 person
  - Chains to anyone within 5 yards
  - Strat: All ranged stay spread at least 5 yards
  
- #### [Cry of Terror](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=123792/cry-of-terror>)
  - Debuff which does raid-wide damage
  - Nothing to be done about it
  - This will be important to deal with the next mechanic
  
  
This is the tricky mechanic for Phase 1
- #### [Dissonance Shield](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=128353/dissonance-field>)
<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/349545-dissonance-field.jpg" width=200>

*Two shields spawned next to each other*

  - Adds which do not target or attack
  - 2 spawn at once
    - twice per phase, at 30 seconds into the pahse and again at 90 seconds 
  - Slowly loses health
  - You can walk on top of the shield, when on the shield will absorb all spells done on it as damage.
  - Spells to someone on the shield have no affect
  - When it dies, it does ~200k Raid damage
    - More to the character(s) on the shield
  - If both die at once, it will be a wipe
  
  - Dealing with this:
    - 1 person with [Cry of Terror](#cry-of-terror) goes into the shield
	- This person will not be able to contribute damage or healing while inside, nor receive healing while inside
	- Our initial plan is for the first person who gets the debuff, other than tanks or healers, will go into one of the shields immediately (this approach may change when we see it in action)
	  - That person will say "[NAME], has the debuff (or cry or whatever), going into the shield"
	  - This alerts the healers to top you up and shield you if they have it available
	- When you start to get low
	  - A healer should tell you to come out to be topped up.
	  - "Get out so I can top you up"
	  - Don't count on that initially, a lot is happening and you will be better at monitoring your own health than the healers
	  - "Out of shield, top me up" or something to that effect
    - We are balancing several things keeping a character in: 
	*(this is primarily up to Jim initially to be tracking before we can get a more rigid set of rules for our strategy)*
	  1. The character's HP
	  1. The raid's HP
	      - We don't want to deliberately push a shield to pop when people will die from the raid damage
	  1. The other shield's HP
	      - We need time to recover HP before the other one burns down
		  - It seems that each one will last approximately 50 sec so we're probably aiming for 25 sec for the shield we focus down
    1. DPS on boss


### Phase 1 Summary
The whole phase is about doing damage to the boss and minimizing/controlling damage into the raid with the [Dissonance Shield](#dissonance-shield) and [Dread Screech](#dread-screech)

- Tanks, swap at 3-4 stacks of [Eyes of the Empress](#eyes-of-the-empress) , otherwise it's a wipe
- Ranged, stay spread to avoid chaining [Dread Screech](#dread-screech)
- If you are the first person to get [Cry of Terror](#cry-of-terror) since the latest [Dissonance Shield](#dissonance-shield) drop, you go to one of the shields
  - Communicate this
  - Do not be inside when it detonates
  - Healers and the person inside the shield, mind HP
  - Jim will be monitoring all the things we were talking about
  
## Phase 2
During this phase the boss summons 2 types of adds and become immune to damage. Because she is immune to damage, she will always go back into [Phase 1](#phase-1) at the end of this phase.

The adds come from the left and right in the form of 1 [Reaver](#korthik-reavers-reavers) and 3 [Windblades](#setthik-windblades-windblades) per side. One tank will pick up the [Reavers](#korthik-reavers-reavers), the other the [Windblades](#setthik-windblades-windblades)

The phase lasts until the adds all die or 2.5 minutes, whichever happens first (So, functionally another dps check with mechanics we use to speed it along)

Our DPS are focusing down the Windblades, but making sure we create amber traps

Any adds that continue into Phase 1 become DPS priority. (Jim should communicate kill order for these)

### Phase 2 Mechanics / Adds:
#### [Set'thik Windblades](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/npc=64453/setthik-windblade>) *(Windblades)*
<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/modelviewer/mists/webthumbs/npc/150/43158.webp" width=200>

- [Band of Valor](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=125417/band-of-valor>) gives all adds within 8 yards a 30% damage done increase and a 5% damage taken decrease
    - Strat: This is why we are not tanking the two groups together.
    - Forcus down individual adds while cleaving as much as possible.
- Occasionally will [Fixate](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=120831/fixate>) on a character for 30 sec
  - Strat: Just kite the add away from group. This lets
- Casts an interruptable spell [Dispatch](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=125877/dispatch>) which buffs them and deals ticking damage to random players
  - Strat: Interrupt this, or if it gets on them dispell it (Looking at you A-A-Ron).
- They drop [Sticky Resin](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=124748/sticky-resin>) on the ground
  - This can be picked up by running over it, this applies a movement debuff and ticking damage
  - When two characters with the debuff come together, they drop a pool on the ground and lose the debuff.
  - Anyone who runs over the pool also loses the debuff.
  - After 4 people run over the pool it becomes an [Amber Trap](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=125803/amber-trap>)
    - This appears like a large orange crystal and will [trap](<www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=125824/trapped>) whatever add is in it
    - Immobilizes and does ticking 5% max health damage every 2 sec to whatever add gets trapped
    - All Windblades will drop aggro and target the prison when something activates it.
    - This is for the [Reavers](#korthik-reavers-reavers) because they have a ton of HP
  - Communication:
    - At first, call out pools when you see them
      - "Pool Here"
    - Jim will be directing people to pick it up intially to create the pool
      - "[Name] pick up a Resin"
      - "Pool is started start picking up resin"
    - After the pool is created, announce when you are picking it up. This alerts the healers, and lets Jim track how many resins are out and being used so we don't have anyone sitting with an unnecesarry DoT.
      - "Picking up resin"
      - "Dropped off resin"
      - "Prison is up"
- Strat for Windblades:
  - Everyone, Kite the [Fixate](#setthik-windblades-windblades) away from the group of adds
  - Everyone, Interrupt [Dispatch](#setthik-windblades-windblades)
  - Anyone, Dispell [Dispatch](#setthik-windblades-windblades) if it gets cast
  - DPS, Pick up [Sticky Resin](#setthik-windblades-windblades) and create/fill **2** pools
  - Tank, when an [Amber Trap](#setthik-windblades-windblades) is made, drag a [Reaver](#korthik-reavers-reavers) into the trap
  - Tank, when a [Reaver](#korthik-reavers-reavers) goes into an [Amber Trap](#setthik-windblades-windblades) re-acquire aggro on the [Windblades](#setthik-windblades-windblades) 
    - (I'm not actually sure this is possible)

#### [Kor'thik Reavers](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/npc=63591/korthik-reaver>) *(Reavers)*
<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/modelviewer/mists/webthumbs/npc/151/43159.webp" width=200>

- [Poison Bomb](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=124777/poison-bomb>) Does initial damage ~93k with an additional tick of ~15k every 2 sec
  - Healers
- [Toxic Slime](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=124807/toxic-slime>) Frontal cone attack doing ~80k damage to anyone inside of it.
  - Tanks, point theses guys away from the raid
  - Raid, avoid being in front of the [Reavers](#korthik-reavers-reavers)
- [Poison-Drenched Armor](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=124821/poison-drenched-armor>) Applies a DPS buff [Poison Fumes](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=124827/poison-fumes>) which occasionally gives you an extra ~50k damage to an attack for 2 min. It will apply to other people who are close to you. (75% proc chance, 3 sec cooldown)
  - Tank, occasionally try to give this to other people (low priority)
  - I think this procs to another character once every 5 sec with a 50% chance.
  - This buff (and the ability to transfer it) persists through death
  - DPS, do not try to manuever to get this, the tank is managing the cone attacks from the [Reavers](#korthik-reavers-reavers)
- Strat for Reavers:
  - Tank them away from the other adds
  - Tank, point them away from raid to avoid unnecessary damage from [Toxic Slime](#korthik-reavers-reavers)
  - Tank, drag them into [Amber Trap](#setthik-windblades-windblades) when it becomes available.

### Phase 2 Summary
This whole phase is about creating traps and killing windblades.

As before, do everything you can to mitigate damage. That includes not having the [Sticky Resin](#setthik-windblades-windblades) before it is needed/ready to be picked up.

- Tanks, split the adds with [Reavers](#korthik-reavers-reavers) near the throne and [Windblades](#setthik-windblades-windblades) near the center of the room.
- DPS, the [Windblades](#setthik-windblades-windblades) are the priority for damage
- DPS, when directed, pick up [Sticky Resin](#setthik-windblades-windblades) to create 2 pools and to fill the pools to create 2 [Amber Traps](#setthik-windblades-windblades)
- Everyone, kite the [Windblades](#setthik-windblades-windblades) away from the pack when [Fixated](#setthik-windblades-windblades)
  - Make sure not to kite a [Windblade](#setthik-windblades-windblades) into an [Amber Trap](#setthik-windblades-windblades)
- Everyone, interrupt [Dispatch](#setthik-windblades-windblades)
- Everyone, dispell [Dispatch](#setthik-windblades-windblades)
- DPS, adds that survive into next phase are priority

## Phase 3
Stack up behind the boss and nuke the shit out of her. Save C/Ds for this phase.

This is the most heal intensive phase, and is a DPS race while continuing to try and avoid unnecessary damage.

Depending on how fast we've burned through the previous phases, and how well incoming damage has been mitigated, will determine how much healing there is left.

The remaining healing availability is what determines how much time we have to burn through this phase.

This is when we bloolust. ***Everyone remind Jim at the beginning of the phase***, "LUST !!!"

### Phase 3 Mechanics:
- #### [Eyes of the Empress](<https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=123707/eyes-of-the-empress>)
