# World of Warcraft Boss Strategies
Written by: Matthew Martin

## Purpose
This repository is a publicly available repo to store my boss strategies and allow easy sharing with my friends and whoever they may want to shar it with.

This gives me a way to improve my Markdown skills, understanding full well that that particular skill is fairly benign and of little more help than someone being proficient with a word-processor application in the 80s.
I primarily enjoy that it is a little more easy to use than LaTeX, and can be easily interpretted in GitHub here.

Additionally, this allows me to work on my proccess analysis and deconfliction skills in a technical document writing style.
Inside, you should find information in a drill-out style of presentation. Which is to say that I will clearly explain in detail the operation of a mechanic, and in that comment on strategies which will be used to solve it. Having explained each individual element, I then explain the complete picture for that phase or element. If a boss requires a complete bringing together of a strategy, that too will get a macro level overview at the end.
